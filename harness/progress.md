# Progress Log

## 2026-04-21 — CI trigger and install simplification
- Who: automation
- Summary: Restricted verify and harness-size workflows to relevant file paths, switched verify to a single full workspace install, and used the existing root scripts for app checks.
- Files changed: .github/workflows/verify-code.yml, .github/workflows/harness-size-check.yml, harness/features/feat-003.json
- Blockers: none
- Next steps: keep any new shared config files in the workflow path filters intentionally.

---

## 2026-04-21 — GitHub verify single-job optimization
- Who: automation
- Summary: Consolidated the PR verify flow into a single job so shared setup and dependency installation happen once, while still running only the affected web and/or worker checks.
- Files changed: .github/workflows/verify-code.yml, harness/features/feat-003.json
- Blockers: none
- Next steps: keep adding any new truly shared config files to the shared change filter intentionally.

---

## 2026-04-21 — GitHub verify scoping
- Who: automation
- Summary: Narrowed the PR verify workflow so web changes only run web checks, worker changes only run worker checks, and shared root workflow/package changes trigger both. Each job now installs and runs only its own workspace package scope.
- Files changed: .github/workflows/verify-code.yml, harness/feature_index.json, harness/features/feat-003.json
- Blockers: none
- Next steps: run repository verification if needed; otherwise keep this workflow pattern for future CI changes.

## 2026-04-21 — Harness contract standardization
- Who: automation
- Summary: Standardized the repository on `harness/` as the canonical state surface and aligned docs, scripts, and handoff workflow.
- Files changed: AGENTS.md, README.md, docs/knowledge/codex-exec-plan.md, docs/knowledge/harness-engineering.md, docs/exec-plans/__plan-template__.md, init.sh, scripts/rotate_progress.sh, scripts/check_harness_size.sh, harness/feature_index.json, harness/features/feat-001.json, harness/features/feat-002.json, harness/session-handoff.md
- Blockers: `./init.sh` still needs network access for `pnpm install`; sandboxed verification without network will fail at dependency install.
- Next steps: keep new feature records in `harness/features/*.json`; use `harness/session-handoff.md` only for unfinished sessions.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Harness verification
- Who: automation
- Summary: Ran `./init.sh` to verify installs, lint, typechecks, tests, and build. All verification steps completed successfully.
- Files changed: harness/features/feat-harness-001.json (feat-harness-001 marked done)
- Blockers: none
- Next steps: keep updating `harness/feature_index.json` and `harness/progress.md` during active work.

---

## 2026-04-21 — Bootstrap harness
- Who: automation
- Summary: Created initial harness artifacts required by `AGENTS.md`.
- Files added: harness/features/feat-harness-001.json, harness/feature_index.json
- Blockers: none
- Next steps: populate `harness/features/*.json` with active features and update during sessions; run `./init.sh` to verify repository checks.

Note: progress logs are now rotated by `scripts/rotate_progress.sh` into `harness/progress/archive/`.
Keep `harness/progress.md` as a short index with newest entries first to avoid large file growth.
